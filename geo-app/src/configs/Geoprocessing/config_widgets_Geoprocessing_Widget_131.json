Options include the following:Average dietary energy supply adequacy (%) (3-year average) - The Dietary Energy Suppy (DES) as a percentage of the Average Dietary Energy Requirement (ADER). Each country's average supply of calories for food consumption is normalized by the average dietary energy requirement estimated for its population to provide an index of adequacy of the food supply in terms of calories.Average value of food production (constant I$ per person) (3-year average) - The indicator expresses the food net production value (in constant 2004-2006 international dollars), as estimated by FAO and published by FAOSTAT, in per capita terms.Share of dietary energy supply derived from cereals, roots and tubers (%) (3-year average) - The indicator expresses the energy supply (in kcal/caput/day) provided by cereals, roots and tubers as a percentage of the total Dietary Energy Supply (DES) (in kcal/caput/day) calculated from the correponding countries in the FAOSTAT food balance sheets.Average protein supply (g/capita/day) (3-year average) - National average protein supply (expressed in grams per caput per day).Average supply of protein of animal origin (g/capita/day) (3-year average) - National average protein supply (expressed in grams per caput per day). It includes the following groups: meat; offals; animal fats and products; milk and products; eggs, fish, seafood and products; and acquatic products, other.Rail-lines density (per 100 square km of land area) - Rail lines density corresponds to the ratio between the length of railway route available for train service, irrespective of the number of parallel tracks (rail lines, total route in km) with the area of the country.Gross domestic product per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $) - GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2011 international dollars.Prevalence of undernourishment (%) (3-year average) - The prevalence of undernourishment expresses the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population consumes an amount of calories that is insufficient to cover her/his energy requirement for an active and healthy life. The indicator is computed by comparing a probability distribution of habitual daily dietary energy consumption with a threshold level called the minimum dietary energy Requirement. Both are based on the notion of an average individual in the reference population.Depth of the food deficit (kcal/capita/day) (3-year average) - The depth of the food deficit indicates how many calories would be needed to lift the undernourished from their status, everything else being constant. The average intensity of food deprivation of the undernourished, estimated as the difference between the average dietary energy requirement and the average dietary energy consumption of the undernourished population (food-deprived), is multiplied by the number of undernourished to provide an estimate of the total food deficit in the country, which is then normalized by the total population.","defaultValue":"Average dietary energy supply adequacy (%) (3-year average)","category":"","choiceList":["Average dietary energy supply adequacy (%) (3-year average)","Average value of food production (constant I$ per person) (3-year average)","Share of dietary energy supply derived from cereals, roots and tubers (%) (3-year average)","Average protein supply (g/capita/day) (3-year average)","Average supply of protein of animal origin (g/capita/day) (3-year average)","Rail-lines density (per 100 square km of land area)","Gross domestic product per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $)","Prevalence of undernourishment (%) (3-year average)","Depth of the food deficit (kcal/capita/day) (3-year average)"],"label":"FAO Food Security Indicator","visible":true,"required":true,"tooltip":"FAO Food Security Indicator"}],"outputParams":[{"name":"Distance_to_Market","dataType":"GPDataFile","description":"","defaultValue":null,"category":"","label":"Distance to Market","visible":true,"required":false,"tooltip":"Distance to Market","ignore":false,"layerInvisible":false},{"name":"Food_Security_Graph","dataType":"GPDataFile","description":"","defaultValue":null,"category":"","label":"Food Security Graph","visible":true,"required":false,"tooltip":"Food Security Graph","ignore":false,"layerInvisible":false},{"name":"Monthly_Rainfall_Graph","dataType":"GPDataFile","description":"","defaultValue":null,"category":"","label":"Monthly Rainfall Graph","visible":true,"required":false,"tooltip":"Monthly Rainfall Graph","ignore":false,"layerInvisible":false}],"shareResults":false,"layerOrder":["Area_of_Interest"],"showExportButton":true}
