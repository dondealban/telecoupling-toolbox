{"name":"NutrientDeliveryRatio","displayName":"Nutrient Delivery Ratio","description":"The objective of the InVEST nutrient delivery model is to map nutrient sources from watersheds and their transport to the stream. This spatial information can be used to assess the service of nutrient retention by natural vegetation. The retention service is of particular interest for surface water quality issues and can be valued in economic or social terms (e.g. avoided treatment costs, improved water security through access to clean drinking water).\n\nSpatial information concerning the export of nutrients from a watershed and areas of high filtration are needed when determining strategies to mitigate water pollution. The nutrient delivery and retention model provides this information for non-point source pollutants. The model was designed for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous), but its structure can be used for other contaminants if data are available on the loading rates and filtration rates of the pollutant of interest.\n\nFor all raster inputs used in this tool, the projection should be defined and the projection's linear units should be in meters.\n\n","category":"","helpUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/directories/arcgisoutput/Geoprocessing/NutrientDeliveryRatioInVEST_GPServer/Geoprocessing_NutrientDeliveryRatioInVEST/NutrientDeliveryRatio.htm","serverInfo":{"currentVersion":10.41,"url":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/NutrientDeliveryRatioInVEST/GPServer/","hasResultMapServer":true,"resultMapServerName":"Geoprocessing/NutrientDeliveryRatioInVEST","supportsUpload":true,"maxUploadFileSize":2000},"useResultMapServer":true,"taskUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/NutrientDeliveryRatioInVEST/GPServer/Nutrient Delivery Ratio","isSynchronous":false,"inputParams":[{"name":"DEM","dataType":"GPRasterDataLayer","description":"A GIS raster layer, with an elevation value for each cell.

The nutrient retention capacity for a given vegetation is expressed as a proportion of the amount of nutrient from upstream. For example, high values (0.6 to 0.8) may be assigned to all natural vegetation types (such as frests, natural pastures, wetlands, or prairie), indicating that 60-80% of nutrient is retained. Like above, suffix _n stands for nitrogen, and _p for phosphorous.crit_len_n (and crit_len_p) (in meters): The distance after which it is assumed that a patch of LULC retains nutrient at its maximum capacity. If nutrients travel a distance smaller than the retention length, the retention efficiency will be less than the maximum value eff_x, following an exponential decay.proportion_subsurface_n (or proportion_subsurface_p) (optional): The proportion of dissolved nutrients over the total amount of nutrients, expressed as ratio between 0 and 1.
