{"name":"HabitatQuality","displayName":"Habitat Quality","description":"The InVEST Habitat Quality model uses habitat quality and rarity as proxies to represent the biodiversity of a landscape, estimating the extent of habitat and vegetation types across a landscape, and their state of degradation. The model combines maps of land use land cover (LULC) with data on threats to habitats and habitat response. Modeling habitat quality alongside ecosystem services enables users to compare spatial patterns and identify areas where conservation will most benefit natural systems and protect threatened species. This model does not attempt to place a monetary value on biodiversity.","category":"","helpUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/directories/arcgisoutput/Geoprocessing/HabitatQualityInVEST_GPServer/Geoprocessing_HabitatQualityInVEST/HabitatQuality.htm","serverInfo":{"currentVersion":10.41,"url":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/HabitatQualityInVEST/GPServer/","hasResultMapServer":true,"resultMapServerName":"Geoprocessing/HabitatQualityInVEST","supportsUpload":true,"maxUploadFileSize":2000},"useResultMapServer":true,"taskUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/HabitatQualityInVEST/GPServer/Habitat Quality","isSynchronous":false,"inputParams":[{"name":"Land_Cover_Raster","dataType":"GPRasterDataLayer","description":"A GDAL-supported raster file.
