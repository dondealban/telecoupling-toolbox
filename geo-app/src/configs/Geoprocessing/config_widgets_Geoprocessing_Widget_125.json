{"name":"Fisheries","displayName":"Fisheries Harvest","description":"Wild capture fisheries provide a significant source of protein for human consumption and directly employ nearly 40 million fishers worldwide (FAO 2014). However, poor harvesting practices and habitat loss and degradation can reduce the ability of ecosystems to support healthy, productive fisheries. The InVEST Fisheries Production model produces estimates of harvest volume and economic value of single-species fisheries. The model is an age- or stage-structured population model, and is presented as a generic model that can be adapted to most species and geographies. Inputs to the model include parameters for life history characteristics (e.g., age at maturity, recruitment, migration and natural mortality rates), behavior of the fishery (e.g., fishing pressure), habitat dependencies (e.g., importance and availability of nursery habitat), and, optionally, economic valuation (e.g., price per unit biomass). The model outputs the volume and economic value of harvest within the area(s) designated by the user. It is best to compare outputs from multiple runs of the model, where each run represents different scenarios of habitat extent, environmental conditions and/or fishing pressure. A library of four sample models is provided, which the user can adapt to their own species or region, or the user can choose to build a model from scratch.","category":"","helpUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/directories/arcgisoutput/Geoprocessing/FisheriesInVEST_GPServer/Geoprocessing_FisheriesInVEST/Fisheries.htm","serverInfo":{"currentVersion":10.41,"url":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/FisheriesInVEST/GPServer/","hasResultMapServer":true,"resultMapServerName":"Geoprocessing/FisheriesInVEST","supportsUpload":true,"maxUploadFileSize":2000},"useResultMapServer":true,"taskUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/FisheriesInVEST/GPServer/Fisheries Harvest","isSynchronous":false,"inputParams":[{"name":"Area_of_Interest","dataType":"GPDataFile","description":"The provided shapefile is used to display outputs within the area of interest.

Each name can be an alphanumeric string. If the AOI shapefile is to be provided, the subregion entries must each match a corresponding ‘Name’ attribute value in a feature of the AOI shapefile. An entry must be provided even if the model is considering only one subregion.Survival Rates from Natural Mortality Matrix (required)- Each unique pair of age/stage and subregion should contain a survival rate from natural mortality, expressed as a decimal fraction.ExploitationFraction (required)- A row starting in the first column with the label ‘ExploitationFraction’. The exploitation fraction is the proportion of the vulnerable population in each subregion that is harvested (0=0% harvested, 1=100% harvested). Each subregion is treated independently (i.e. up to 100% of the vulnerable population in each subregion may be harvested).LarvalDispersal- A row starting in the first column labeled ‘LarvalDispersal’. The larval dispersal is the proportion of the cumulative larvae pool that disperses into each subregion. Each subregion column should have a decimal to represent this. Dispersal across all subregions should add up to 1. If larval dispersal isn’t provided, larvae will be dispersed equally across all subregions.VulnFishing (required)- A column labeled ‘VulnFishing’, which is the relative vulnerability to harvest for each class. A decimal value for each class listed in this column is required. The most vulnerable age(s)/stage(s) should have a value of 1.0, indicating full vulnerability.Maturity- A column labeled ‘Maturity’. It represents the fraction of that age or stage which is mature and contributes to the spawning stock. A decimal value for each age/stage is required if maturity is included. For classes which do not reproduce, this should be 0.Duration- A column labeled ‘Duration’. This column is required for stage-based models. It represents the number of time steps for which an average individual will be in that stage before moving to the next one.Weight- A column which is required if ‘Spawners by Weight’ or ‘Harvest by Weight’ is selected. This is the average biomass of an individual of the population at each age/stage expressed in model-agnostic units and is required for each of the ages/stages listed in the classes column.","defaultValue":"itemID:","category":"","label":"Population Parameters File (.csv)","visible":true,"required":true,"tooltip":"Population Parameters File (.csv)"},{"name":"Total_Initial_Recruits","dataType":"GPDouble","description":"The initial number of recruits in the population model at time equal to zero.
