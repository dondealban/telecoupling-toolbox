{"name":"DrawRadialFlows","displayName":"Draw Radial Flows","description":"Radial flows have a spoke-like pattern where features and places are mapped in nodal form with one place being a common origin or destination. Flows represent the movement of material or energy between a sending and a receiving system. Arrows show the direction of the movement.","category":"","helpUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/directories/arcgisoutput/Geoprocessing/DrawRadialFlowsExport_GPServer/Geoprocessing_DrawRadialFlowsExport/DrawRadialFlows.htm","serverInfo":{"currentVersion":10.41,"url":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/DrawRadialFlowsExport/GPServer/","hasResultMapServer":false,"resultMapServerName":"","supportsUpload":true,"maxUploadFileSize":2000},"useResultMapServer":false,"taskUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/DrawRadialFlowsExport/GPServer/Draw Radial Flows","isSynchronous":true,"inputParams":[{"name":"Input_Flows_Table","dataType":"GPDataFile","description":"The table containing records on each flow between an origin and a destination.

GREAT_CIRCLE—A type of geodetic line which represents the path between any two points along the intersection of the surface of the earth and a plane that passes through the center of the earth. Depending on the output coordinate system specified by the Spatial Reference parameter, in a spheroid-based coordinate system, the line is a great elliptic; in a sphere-based coordinate system, the line is uniquely called a great circle—a circle of the largest radius on the spherical surface. RHUMB_LINE—A type of geodetic line, also known as a loxodrome line, which represents a path between any two points on the surface of a spheroid defined by a constant azimuth from a pole. A rhumb line is shown as a straight line in the Mercator projection. NORMAL_SECTION—A type of geodetic line which represents a path between any two points on the surface of a spheroid defined by the intersection of the spheroid surface and a plane that passes through the two points and is normal (perpendicular) to the spheroid surface at the starting point of the two points.
