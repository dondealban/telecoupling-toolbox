{"name":"NutritionMetrics","displayName":"Nutrition Metrics","description":"Estimates the population within an Area of Interest (AOI) by age groups and then calculates the Lower Limit of Energy Requirement (LLER; in kilocalories / day) for age groups within the AOI. NOTE: This tool will only run with Areas of Interest in Africa, Asia, or South America / Central America / Caribbean.\n\nAge groups are five year intervals for both males and females. For example, Female 0-4, Female 5-9, Male 0-4, Male 5-9. The final age grouping for both males and females is 65+, which includes all individuals aged 65 and greater. NOTE: No population information exists for the Africa Male 65+ age group in the Year 2020; thus '999999999' is returned for both the population and LLER in this age group.\n\nThis tool produces a shapefile of the AOI with population and LLER information appended to it. LLER is reported in kilocalories per day for the entire AOI for each age group as well as for the population as a whole. Therefore, if the Male 0-4 age group reports a LLER value of 53,650,000, this indicates that within the AOI, a total of 53,650,000kilocalories / day would be needed to feed all of the males in the 0-4 age group (this would need to be divided by the Male 0-4 population if one wanted to estimate kilocalories / person / day).\n\nRefer to the Tool Help for details concerning calculation of Lower Limit of Energy Requirement.\n","category":"","helpUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/directories/arcgisoutput/Geoprocessing/NutritionMetrics_GPServer/Geoprocessing_NutritionMetrics/NutritionMetrics.htm","serverInfo":{"currentVersion":10.41,"url":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/NutritionMetrics/GPServer/","hasResultMapServer":false,"resultMapServerName":"","supportsUpload":true,"maxUploadFileSize":2000},"useResultMapServer":false,"taskUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/NutritionMetrics/GPServer/Nutrition Metrics","isSynchronous":false,"inputParams":[{"name":"Area_of_Interest","dataType":"GPFeatureRecordSetLayer","description":"Shapefile indicating the Area of Interest (AOI).
