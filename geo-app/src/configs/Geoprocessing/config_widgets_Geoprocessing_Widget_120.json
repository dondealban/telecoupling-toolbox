{"name":"SeasonalWaterYield","displayName":"Seasonal Water Yield","description":"There is a high demand for tools estimating the effect of landscape management on water supply service (e.g. for irrigation, domestic use, hydropower production). While the InVEST annual water yield model provides an estimate of total water yield for a catchment, many applications require knowledge of seasonal flows, especially during the dry season. This requires the understanding of hydrological processes in a catchment, in particular the partitioning between quick flow (occurring during or shortly after rain events) and baseflow (occurring during dry weather). In highly seasonal climates, baseflow is likely to provide greater value than the quick flow, unless significant storage (e.g., a large reservoir) is available. The InVEST seasonal water yield model seeks to provide guidance regarding the contribution of land parcels to the generation of both baseflow and quick flow. The model computes spatial indices that quantifies the relative contribution of a parcel of land to the generation of both baseflow and quick flow. Currently, there are no quantitative estimates of baseflow (only the relative contributions of pixels); a separate tool is in development to address this question.","category":"","helpUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/directories/arcgisoutput/Geoprocessing/SeasonalWaterYieldInVEST_GPServer/Geoprocessing_SeasonalWaterYieldInVEST/SeasonalWaterYield.htm","serverInfo":{"currentVersion":10.41,"url":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/SeasonalWaterYieldInVEST/GPServer/","hasResultMapServer":true,"resultMapServerName":"Geoprocessing/SeasonalWaterYieldInVEST","supportsUpload":true,"maxUploadFileSize":2000},"useResultMapServer":true,"taskUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/SeasonalWaterYieldInVEST/GPServer/Seasonal Water Yield","isSynchronous":false,"inputParams":[{"name":"Evapotranspiration_Directory","dataType":"GPDataFile","description":"Maps of monthly reference evapotranspiration (mm).
